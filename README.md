### About my visualizations

Visualization 1 (CO2 emission in tons for each countries) - It uses choropleth showing CO2 emission in tons for each countries. Placing the cursor over the country will show the country name and the CO2 emission.

Visualization 2 (GDP and area on CO2 emission in 2020) - It shows the relationship between GDP and area of the country with CO2 emission. It highlight countries like Japan, China, and Russia. It shows that countries with higher land area tend to have higher CO2 emission, which GDP per capita might not be correlated.
